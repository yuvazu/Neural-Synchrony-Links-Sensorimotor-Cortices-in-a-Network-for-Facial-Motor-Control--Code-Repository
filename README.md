This repository contains all code and scripts for reproducing the figures in: Neural Synchrony Links Sensorimotor Cortices in a Network for Facial Motor Control -Code Repository

## Repository structure
Figure 2 (functional connectivity, eLFPs)
Figure 3 ( Plots PPC & Granger for two facial expressions ) 
Figure 4 ( Power + TFR) 
Figure Supplementary 2 ( Plots PPC & Granger for facial expressions + voluntary movements) 

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2023a ( or later)
- Toolbox: Signal processing + FieldTrip (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/)

## How to USe
Each figure folder contains:
- 'readme.txt' - instructions for that figure
- '.m' files - MATLAB scripts for analysis and plotting
